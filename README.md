# cpp17_in_TTs
Descriptions of C++17 features, presented mostly in "Tony Tables" (hey, the tables were my idea, but name wasn't).

There are actually over 100 changes in C++17, only some of them are listed here.

See the list of files in the repo - typically one file per feature (hopefully obvious via the file name).
Or look at them all at once in [ALL_IN_ONE.md](ALL_IN_ONE.md) (which is regenerated semi-regularly)

Some sources and/or places for good C++17 info:
